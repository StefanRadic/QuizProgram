1. Java is required for this program to launch (jdk or jre). Also an execution environment must be set in order for this application to run properly. This can be done by typing these commands in the command prompt (windows);

   setx -m PATH "%JAVA_HOME%\bin;%PATH%"
   setx -m JAVA_HOME "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-19"

   Command prompt must be re-open after these commands were set in. To verify that the Environment Variable has been set, type: "java -version" (without quotes).

2. The JOptionPane unfortunately doesn't have an icon visible on the taskbar. In case if program gets invisible, simply alt+tab to find it.
